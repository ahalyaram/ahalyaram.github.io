A literature major’s love of words, stories and myths that mediate the world for us; a gratitudinous immigrant’s yearning to parse through obstreperous questions of my American society; a teacher’s zeal both for sharing and procuring knowledge; these are the tools I use to engage with the world.

I am a former academic professor having had the good fortune to teach German language and literature at University of Connecticut and Middlebury College.

After having traversed interesting verticals-HigherEd, LMS and Data Storage-Virtualization, I relish my role of SAAS Success Lead. With a motto of “ethics first, everything else next”, I marshal resources—Product Management, Support, Engineering, R&D, Platform & Custom Schema—to address customer issues, resulting in clear accountability, consistent service and one face to the customer. I pride myself in understanding key business issues and processes of my customers almost like an insider of their organization.
